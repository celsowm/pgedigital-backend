## Verification

All documented features have been verified to exist in the codebase:
- ✅ All DML classes exist and are exported
- ✅ All window functions exist and are exported
- ✅ PostgreSQL dialect exists and is exported
- ✅ `belongsToMany` relation function exists and is exported
- ✅ All utility functions exist and are exported
- ✅ AST builders (`buildColumnNode`, `buildColumnNodes`, `createTableNode`) exist and are exported
- ✅ Visitor helpers for `TypeScriptGenerator` exist and are exported (`visitExpression`, `visitOperand`, `ExpressionVisitor`, `OperandVisitor`)

The documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the MetalORM library with all its advanced features.
