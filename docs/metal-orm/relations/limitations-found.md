# Limitations and Issues Found in Relations SQL Generation

During comprehensive testing with real SQLite database execution, several limitations and issues were discovered in Metal ORM's relation SQL generation:

## 1. Self-Referencing Relations Bug ⚠️

**Issue**: Self-referencing relations generate SQL with ambiguous column names
**Impact**: Causes SQL errors in strict databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)

**Query Builder Code That Produces This**:
```typescript
// This query builder code generates the problematic SQL below
const users = defineTable('users', {
    id: col.primaryKey(col.int()),
    name: col.varchar(255),
    manager_id: col.int()
});

users.relations = {
    managedUsers: hasMany(users, 'manager_id')  // Self-reference
};

const query = new SelectQueryBuilder(users)
    .include('managedUsers', {
        columns: ['id', 'name']
    })
    .where(eq(users.columns.id, 1));
```

**Problematic SQL Generated**:
```sql
SELECT "users"."id" AS "id", 
       "users"."name" AS "name", 
       "users"."id" AS "managedUsers__id", 
       "users"."name" AS "managedUsers__name"
FROM "users" 
LEFT JOIN "users" ON "users"."manager_id" = "users"."id"
WHERE "users"."id" = ?;
```

**Error**: `SQLITE_ERROR: ambiguous column name: users.id`

**Root Cause**: When joining the same table, the ORM doesn't generate unique table aliases, leading to duplicate column names.

**Workaround**: Use separate queries for self-referencing relations until this is fixed.

**Code evidence**: `relation-conditions.ts` builds joins using the base table names (`src/query-builder/relation-conditions.ts:24-49`) and `relation-service.ts` never rewrites those joins to use unique aliases for the second copy of the table (`src/query-builder/relation-service.ts:51-185`), so SQLite/Postgres receive duplicate `users.id` references in the projection.

## 2. Deep Nested Relations Performance Design 🔄

**Issue**: Relations nested beyond one level don't generate complex multi-JOIN SQL
**Impact**: May require multiple queries instead of single complex query

**Behavior**:
```typescript
.include('posts', {
  include: {
    comments: true  // This level loaded separately
  }
})
```

**SQL Generated**: Only includes 'posts' in main query, 'comments' loaded via separate lazy-load query

**Design Choice**: This is actually intentional for performance - prevents exponential JOIN complexity

## 3. JOIN Operations Not Available 🚫

**Issue**: Direct JOIN operations not supported in query builder
**Impact**: Cannot perform manual JOINs outside of relation system

**Missing Feature**:
```typescript
// This doesn't work
.select(User)
.join('posts', 'LEFT')
.join('comments', 'LEFT')
```

**Alternative**: Must use relation-based `.include()` operations

## 4. Complex Relation Matching Limitations 🔍

**Issue**: Complex `.match()` operations with multiple conditions had syntax issues
**Impact**: Advanced filtering on related entities may not work as expected

**Attempted**:
```typescript
.match('roles', {
  name: like('%admin%')
})
```

**Error**: Column reference issues in match expressions

**Code evidence**: `relation-service.ts` obtains a predicate by reusing the joined relation without aliasing the predicate's columns (`src/query-builder/relation-service.ts:73-211`), so any `.match()` that references columns shared between the root and the joined relation ends up pointing to the same table name twice.

## 5. Column Selection in Nested Relations 🎯

**Issue**: When using nested includes, column selection doesn't propagate to nested levels
**Impact**: May load more columns than necessary in nested relations

**Example**:
```typescript
.include('posts', {
  columns: ['id', 'title'],  // Only applies to posts
  include: {
    comments: true  // Loads ALL comment columns
  }
})
```

## 6. Batch Loading Assumptions 📦

**Issue**: Documentation suggests batch loading works automatically, but may require specific patterns
**Impact**: Developers might write inefficient queries expecting automatic batching

**Expected**:
```typescript
const users = await query.execute();
// All users' posts loaded in single batch
for (const user of users) {
  await user.posts.load(); // Should use batch
}
```

**Reality**: May generate individual queries depending on relation configuration

## 7. Pagination with Relations Complexity 📄

**Issue**: CTE-based pagination with relations can generate complex SQL
**Impact**: Performance may degrade with large result sets and multiple relations

**Pattern Found**:
```sql
WITH "__metal_pagination_base" AS (
  SELECT ...complex multi-table joins...
),
"__metal_pagination_page" AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ...pagination logic...
)
SELECT ...final results...
```

## Summary of Impact

| Limitation | Severity | Workaround |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Self-referencing ambiguous columns | **High** | Use separate queries |
| Deep nested relation loading | **Medium** | Accept multiple queries |
| No direct JOIN operations | **Medium** | Use include() instead |
| Complex match operations | **Low** | Use where() on main query |
| Column selection propagation | **Low** | Explicit column selection |
| Batch loading assumptions | **Low** | Test with large datasets |
| Pagination complexity | **Low** | Monitor query performance |

## Recommendations for Users

1. **Avoid self-referencing relations** in complex queries until bug is fixed
2. **Accept multiple queries** for deep nested relations as designed
3. **Use include() instead of direct JOINs** for relation queries
4. **Test with real data volumes** to validate performance assumptions
5. **Enable query logging** to monitor actual SQL generation
6. **Consider query complexity** when designing relation structures

These limitations are primarily architectural choices or bugs that developers should be aware of when designing their data access patterns.

## Bug Fix Plans

1. **Self-referencing join aliasing** - When `relation-service.joinRelation` builds joins for a self-relation, it should detect when an alias is necessary (i.e., when the same table already appears in the query), create or reuse a stable alias, and pass it into `createJoinNode`. Extend join metadata so the alias is recorded alongside the join node, then update the relation join-condition builder (`relation-conditions.ts`) to render ON/WHERE predicates and projection columns using the chosen alias instead of the base table name. Add the aliasing logic only when needed to avoid redundant layers of naming, and keep projection rewriting in sync so each column reference remains unambiguous.
2. **match predicate scoping** – `RelationService.match` should introduce a scoped alias for the joined relation (or reuse the alias produced in step 1) and rewrite the provided predicate to target that alias before adding it to the ON/WHERE clause, ensuring `like`, `eq`, etc. refer to the aliased table rather than the root table.
